# LOWF - The Lisp Web Framework

(Pronounced like a loaf of bread.)

An attempt at building a web application in common lisp.

## Objectives

- build a simple functional website
- architect the software so the web server can be re-used elsewhere
- build and maybe deploy the site publically

## Requirements

- SBCL 2.4.3
- emacs / slime / quicklisp
- sqlite or postgres


So the thing I am doing here is developing a full-fledged application
and building LOWF as part of that, then when the time is ready i'll pull
LOWF out as its own thing and publish it, which is to say that the
application may not be "open" but LOWF will (hopefully) be.
